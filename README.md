## What is this software for?

Deriving unknown facts for outcomes from a knowledge base of known facts using propositional logic and forward chaining to look at all likely possible worlds; that's the general basic gist. This can and will be applied to more than crime, but I'm starting with the crime module because of personal circumstances, and I'm also fucking sick of at least 75% of criminals; ya fuckin' filth(although I must state that I'm not exempt, I'm still in my rehabilitation period so I myself am still currently a criminal, but not filthy like the 75%).

## I DO NOT HAVE ANY DATING PROFILES OR SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILES, ALL CONTACT INFO IS ON MY GITHUB BIO

## PEOPLE ARE MAKING DEEPFAKE PICTURES/VIDEOS/ETC TO DEFAME/SHAME/INTIMIDATE/INCRIMINATE SO DO DUE DILIGENCE; THE AGE OF AI ISN'T ALL GOOD

## DONT BOTHER CONTACTING ME, THEY HAVE EITHER HIRED A CORRUPT POLICE OFFICER TO INTERCEPT CALLS AND TEXTS OR A HACKER TO USE SS7 ATTACKS; INTERCEPTING MAIL ALSO

## A message for the criminals that bark at me, call me a dog and a rat, and are spreading the video of my having been drugged and raped, as well as beaten and tortured:

Peter Gerard Scully hung an 18 month old girl from the ceiling with a piece of rope around her ankle and raped her with a dildo until she was disabled and almost dead, and then sold copies of the video for $10k each, and somehow, he was STILL a better person than any of you, he had more morals as well as more value, both in dollars and virtue, and he harmed less children in a less vehement manner than any of you; make your mother proud and overdose on fentanyl you dirty rat cunts, that's the only value any person could derive from you.

- Why does the legal system exist? Because of people like you.
- Why do the police exist? Because of people like you.
- Why does money exist? Because of people like you.
- Why are drugs either illegal or difficult to obtain? Because of people like you.
- Why did society start building prisons? Because of people like you.

Kind of sounds as though all of you are the only reasons any of you filth have any fucking problems, huh?

Allow me to reiterate, fucking overdose you filthy rat cunts, you aren't even worth anything more than that to yourselves, let alone others. And if you have children, either have the compassion to euthanize them, or the decency to put them in foster care where they belong, with a real family comprised of real people. You know full well that you don't deserve the privilege or the honor. It's rude that you lie to everyone else, but it's disgusting, pathetic, and disdainful that you're dumb enough to lie to yourselves and believe it. The only good thing you have to offer others is your absence, especially when it comes to your children.

I have been shot at on more than one occasion, I have been poisoned with fentanyl and fuck knows what else, I have been drugged, raped and tortured, and I have been gangstalked alongside a vicious smear campaign where I've been called a schizophrenic pedophile for at least 10 years now, and i have proven myself to be too expensive of an issue for any of you spineless filth to deal with; I got sick of your shit a long time ago, and you have no fucking right to be upset that I'm fighting back now. Seeing as all of you want to play games with me and my life, I've decided to play a game of my own, it's called "kenneling the fucking dogs and laughing at the barks." And seeing as all of you want to leave a lasting impact on my life, I've decided to do the same for yours.

Just remember, this could have gone VERY fucking different, I would have upheld the law of silence if any of you did. Call me a dog and I'll fucking bark and bite like one, call me a rat and I'll scamper into your drainpipe and bite through your fucking wires. I've never committed a murder, but I am the reason some of you have been murdered, not by commission, but by a refusal of my omission, and your own stupidity, and neglect. They deserved their deaths, and I have no fucking regrets, my hands are clean simply because it wasn't my fucking negligence nor was I directly responsible or implicated in any way. And now, I'm attacking you with something you'll never understand, basic fucking mathematics.

## A message to my family and the people they all hired:

## A message to criminals who aren't part of the filthy 75%:

I understand, the world is harsh, cruel, and neglectful for the most part, and sometimes doing the wrong things for either the right reasons, or out of blatant necessity can't be helped. Just continue to allow yourself to look for better options than the bad hand that you've been dealt, and remember that you deserve better, and you are also capable of it.

Listen to or read Desiderata, they are words we can all use, and they are words we all need.

## A message for my daughter:

I love you, I'm sorry I was never there, but it was more of a blessing for you than a curse, when you were born I was not a man worthy of fatherhood, and I clearly have issues now even though I'm trying to change for the better. I just hope that this makes a safer and better world for you and your future family.

One day I hope to meet you and get to know you, I would like to cook you a meal and hear your voice, amongst many other things.
