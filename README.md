## What is this software for?

Deriving unknown facts for outcomes from a knowledge base of known facts using propositional logic and forward chaining to look at all likely possible worlds; that's the general basic gist. This can and will be applied to more than crime, but I'm starting with the crime module because of personal circumstances, and I'm also fucking sick of criminals; ya fuckin' filth(although I must state that I'm not exempt, I'm still in my rehabilitation period so I myself am still currently a criminal).
