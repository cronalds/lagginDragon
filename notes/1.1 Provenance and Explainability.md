Provenance / Explainability

For each fact store:

- Raw sources (documents/audio/transcript pointers)
- Inference chain: list of `(RuleId, InputFactIds, EvalResults, ConfidenceDelta)`
- Human-readable explanation generator: convert chain into natural language via templating.

Explainability requirements (for legal/defense/health):

- Reconstructable full chain (no data loss).
- Tamper-evidence (append-only ledger with signatures).
- Versioning of rule sets used (so you can show which rule definition produced the inference).
