## 5\. Handling Contradictions

Contradictions are **inevitable** in legal/medical contexts. You can model them as:

- **Set pruning** → discard impossible worlds (like you planned).
- **Conflict marking** → mark as "inconsistent" and hold both until evidence collapses one.
- **Meta-rules** → higher-order rules to resolve contradictions (e.g., "eyewitness > rumor").
