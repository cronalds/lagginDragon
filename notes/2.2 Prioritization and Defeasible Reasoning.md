Implement multiple priority layers:

- `GlobalPolicyPriority` (laws, jurisdictional precedence)
- `RulePriority` (domain designer)
- `SourceReputation` (data source)
- `FactCertaintyScore` (numeric)
- `TemporalPriority` (newer evidence > older)

Defeasible logic approach:

- Rules can be marked `defeater` or `defeasible`.
- A defeasible rule can be overridden by a higher-priority conflicting rule (record both derivations).
- Always attach **explainability**: why one rule overrode another (trace shows exact priority comparisons).
