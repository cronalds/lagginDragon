Short-circuiting rules (practical points)

- `AND` (Conjunction): stop at first `False`. If first non-False is `Unknown` but `unknown-is-possible`, you may still continue evaluating other antecedents to collect more provenance â€” but **treat the overall as triggering** for forward-chaining. Still create `ShortCircuitPoint` entry to show why it triggered.
- `OR` (Disjunction): stop at first `True` or (if allowed) `Unknown`. Record which branch satisfied.
- Always record the **full list of evaluated sub-commands** even if some were not executed (log them as `NotEvaluated` with reason).
- Short-circuit reason strings MUST be standard tokens (e.g., `"AND_STOP_AT_FALSE"`, `"OR_STOP_AT_TRUE"`) but also contain human-friendly message via Kanban template.
