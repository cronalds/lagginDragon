- Store rule version id and rule hash alongside every `TraceEntry`. To replay an old trace, you must be able to fetch the original rule definitions by version id.
- Keep a `ReplayEngine` which uses stored trace to reproduce evaluation (deterministic).
- Persist mappings from `EntityId` â†’ raw evidence (audio transcript anchors, doc ids) for legal discovery.
