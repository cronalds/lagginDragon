Core concepts (short)

- **Fact**: atomic tri-valued assertion about an `Entity` + `PredicateType` + `EnumValue` + `Certainty` + `Decoration`.
- **Rule**: `Antecedents` â‡’ `Consequents`, with `Priority`, `Defeasible`, `ContextFilter`.
- **Evaluator**: command-facade that returns `EvalResult` (`False|Unknown|True` + provenance + score).
- **World**: an inference-scoped view of KB; forks on `Unknown` to create parallel worlds; each world has its own KB delta and trace.
- **TraceEntry**: append-only record of each evaluation step (short-circuit points included).
- **Agenda**: ordered rule queue sorted by `CardinalRank` and contextual metrics.
