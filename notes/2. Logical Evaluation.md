### a. Short-Circuiting (like logical gates)

- If a premise evaluates to **false**, no need to check the rest (`AND` short-circuit).
- If an **OR** is satisfied, skip the rest.

### b. Value Propagation

Example rule:
```nginx
girlAllegedlyRaped ⇒ girlMaybeRaped
```

But if later:
```ini
Evidence = strong AND Witness = credible ⇒ girlRaped
```

This overrides `maybe`.

So you need a **priority/strength system** for facts:

- `confirmed > alleged > denied`
- Rule consequences must respect these orderings.
