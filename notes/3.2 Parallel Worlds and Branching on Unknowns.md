Parallel worlds and branching on Unknowns

Mechanics:

- When a command returns `Unknown` for a fact that is **pivot** (i.e., triggers alternate consequences), create two child worlds:
	- WorldA: assume `Ternary = True` for that predicate (and apply consequences accordingly).
	- WorldB: assume `Ternary = False` for that predicate.
- Both worlds inherit the parent's KB; only store deltas for changed/added facts.
- Continue forward-chaining independently per-world. Each world gets its own `Trace` and `Conflict` list.
- When worlds produce identical KB deltas for all predicates, **merge** to avoid explosion. Use structural equality on relevant predicates to decide mergeability.
- Provide a world `Score` (aggregate of certainties, source strengths) to allow pruning/ranking later.

Storage & performance:

- Persist only diffs. Use copy-on-write or a persistent map so worlds are cheap.
- Apply constraint propagation in each world to prune early: if a new consequence contradicts an antecedent in the same world, mark conflict and possibly halt that branch (or keep for analysis).
- Provide tools to view aggregated results across worlds (e.g., "How many worlds result in `GirlRaped = True`?").
