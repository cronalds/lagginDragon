Conflict handling strategies (3 patterns)

1. **Flag & Hold (default for high-stakes)**
	- Record conflict, add to `ConflictQueue`, mark facts as `Conflicted`.
	- Notify analyst; do not auto-resolve.
	- Pros: safe for legal/defense; audit-friendly.
	- Cons: human-in-the-loop required.
	- Solution: provide analyst UI & suggested resolution heuristics.
2. **Cardinal Rule Resolution (automated)**
	- Use `CardinalRank` on facts and `Rule.Priority` to pick winner.
	- Tie-breakers: newer timestamp, higher confidence, source reputation.
	- Pros: automatable for low/medium risk decisions.
	- Cons: risk automating wrong choice.
	- Solution: produce “explainability” package and fallback to Flag & Hold if confidence < threshold.
3. **Paraconsistent / Possible-Worlds**
	- Keep both facts and spin separate scenarios/worlds.
	- Compute downstream consequences per world and score them.
	- Pros: shows full picture of possibilities.
	- Cons: combinatorial explosion.
	- Solution: prune low-plausibility worlds via scoring and use constraint propagation to reduce combinations.

Recommended hybrid: **Flag & Hold** for top-tier applications + Cardinal Rule Resolution for non-critical automation + Possible-worlds for deep analysis.
