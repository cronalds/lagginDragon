### a. Fact States

Facts are elements of a set, drawn from finite domains:

### b. Premises

Premises are **conditions on these sets**:
```java
if RapeStatus = girlAllegedlyRaped AND Assault = allegedAssault
then Investigation = required
```

### c. Horn Clauses and Logical/Comparative Operands for Forward Chaining (extended)

Horn clause in standard logic:  
`(P1 ∧ P2 ∧ ... ∧ Pn) ⇒ Q`
- `P` and `Q` may be **multivalued predicates**, not just true/false.
- `maybe` must propagate downstream unless collapsed into yes/no by further evidence.

There will also be the use of other logical and comparative operands, but horn clausing is the basic idea(all operands will be facaded so s to simplify tracing and logging, as well as lessen human error); short circuit upon unwanted value, either short-circuit on true/false if desired, but always branch into parallel likely possible worlds upon unknown and continue the forward chain until either tautology, contradiction, or definitively remaining as unknown after extinguishing all relevant facts from kb.
