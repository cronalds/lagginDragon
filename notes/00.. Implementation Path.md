1. **Core types + trace ledger** — implement IFact, TraceEntry, EvalResult, World, and minimal persistence layer.
2. **Command evaluator & Conjunction/Disjunction commands** — implement facades and short-circuit logging.
3. **Simple rule engine (forward-chaining)** — agenda builder, rule selection by cardinal priority, apply consequences.
4. **World forking on Unknown** — spawn root + simple branching logic with diffs.
5. **Conflict flagging & Kanban generator** — basic Kanban templates for analyst review.
6. **RuleBuilder + DSL prototype** — LL(k) parser (or simple parser combinators) to allow non-programmer rule creation.
7. **UI for analysts** — show worlds, traces, and resolution controls.
8. **Hardening** — replay capability, signing traces, RBAC, encryption.

Start with a **single domain** (one rule deck for e.g., initial triage in law enforcement) — make it rock-solid before expanding modules.
