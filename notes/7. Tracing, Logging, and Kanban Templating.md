Tracing / Logging / Kanban templating

Trace is first-class. Each evaluation creates a `TraceEntry`; store it in an append-only ledger for audit. Keep:

- Compact machine-friendly JSON for automated processing.
- Templated kanban text for human review (kanban cards contain Title, Who, Evidence summary, Trace log, Suggested disposition).
- Support multiple templates for different audiences (court-friendly, analyst, field operator).

Kanban templating:

- Template engine receives TraceEntry + TemplateId → formatted card.
- Card fields: `CaseId`, `Priority`, `Summary`, `Dependencies`, `Conflicts`, `ActionsRecommended`, `RulesApplied`.
- Localize templates per language and legal culture.

Trace indexing:

- Index by `FactId`, `RuleId`, `TraceId`, `EntityId`, `CaseId`.
- Efficiently retrievable to reconstruct the “from → to” derivation path.
---
- Every `TraceEntry` links to rule ids, fact snapshots, world ids, and short-circuit reasons.
- Make traces **append-only** and signable (for tamper evidence).
- Kanban templates map `TraceEntry` → card fields. Provide templates for audiences:
	- `Court` (concise, formal: facts, chain, sources, timestamps)
	- `Analyst` (detailed: all traces, intermediate evaluations)
	- `Operator` (action-oriented: what to do, confidence, suggested next steps)
- Template engine: token replacement + small script support (no external code), kept safe.
