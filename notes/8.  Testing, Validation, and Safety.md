Testing layers:

1. **Unit tests**
	- Evaluate single rules with mocked facts; assert produced facts and trace.
2. **Property tests / fuzzing**
	- Random facts + rules; assert no infinite loops; assert trace completeness.
3. **Scenario tests**
	- Realistic case files with expected outputs (including contradictions).
4. **Explainability tests**
	- Round-trip: run inference → produce explanation → parse explanation → reproduce same conclusion.
5. **Security / tamper tests**
	- Verify audit trail immutability.

Critical safety items:

- “Reject automation” thresholds — never auto-commit to external action for high-stakes conclusions.
- Audit logs must be immutable and exportable.
- RBAC and encrypted storage for sensitive facts.
