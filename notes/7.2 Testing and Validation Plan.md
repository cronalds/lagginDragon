- Unit tests for `PredicateEvalCommand`, `ConjunctionCommand`, `DisjunctionCommand`, `RuleEvalCommand`.
- Integration tests with small KBs and expected final worlds.
- Replay tests: run inference, serialize trace, reload trace, replay â€” results must match.
- Load tests: measure branching growth with controlled unknown frequency; assert pruning thresholds behave.
- Policy tests: ensure that when `unknown-is-possible = true`, rule triggers, and trace reflects the `Unknown` origin.
